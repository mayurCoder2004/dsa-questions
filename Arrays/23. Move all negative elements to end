                                               // Approach

/* 
      Step 1 :- Make two stacks pos ans neg, pos will store positive elements and neg will store negative elements
      Step 2 :- We will also count the number of positive numbers and number of negative numbers using variables p1 and n1
      Step 3 :- We will now run the loop from p1-1 to 0 which we will add the positive numbers in the range from p1-1 to 0
      Step 4 :- We will now run another loop from temp (the variable in which p1 is stored because p1 will become 0 after the first loop) to temp which will the add the negative numbers

// Code :-

public class Solution {
    public static void segregateElements(int [] arr){
        int n = arr.length;

        Stack<Integer> pos = new Stack<>();
        Stack<Integer> neg = new Stack<>();

        int p1 = 0, n1 = 0;

        for (int i=0; i<n; i++){
            if (arr[i] >= 0){
                pos.push(arr[i]);
                p++;
            }
            else {
                neg.push(arr[i]);
                n++;
            }
        }

        int temp = p1;

        for (int i=p1-1; i>=0; i--){
            arr[i] = pos.pop();
        }

        for (int j=n1-1; j>=temp; j--){
            arr[j] = neg.pop();
        }
    }
